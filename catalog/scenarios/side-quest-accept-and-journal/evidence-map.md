# Quest - Accept, Journal, Update - Evidence Map

This map joins two repository-owned products:

- `derived/observations.json` supplies numeric observations.
- `derived/opcode_names.json` supplies names promoted from xivl-opcodes:opcodes.json.
- Raw captures live in `sources/pcap-1.23b/objects/`.

## Captures (3)

- `accept_quest.pcapng` - 53,180 B, 15 distinct opcodes (map 16).
- `quest_journal.pcapng` - 32,264 B, 5 distinct opcodes (map 6).
- `quest_update.pcapng` - 66,756 B, 14 distinct opcodes (map 15).

## Observed opcodes (17 distinct)

Union across the member captures. `name` is the derived/opcode_names.json entry name; `retail class` is the retail_class_name attribution when known.

## Verification

- Every opcode above comes from `derived/observations.json` joined with `derived/opcode_names.json` for the member pcaps. No opcode is added manually.
- Member sizes and sha256 were taken from this repo's `sources/pcap-1.23b/objects/`; the canonical hashes live in `sources/pcap-1.23b/manifest.yaml`.

## Gaps / caveats

- Opcode identity and framing only; decoded payload field semantics live in this repo's `derived/` (payload_layouts.json and friends).
- content_kind side-quest is the generic quest-state reading; the captures do not identify the specific quest, so it could be a class/job/story quest. Refine if the quest is identified.
